            <p>You can call me Akri, or you can know me as Kudatu. Akri is short for Akrivos/Akribos, a greek word (ακριβός) for dear. Kudatu is a word play of two words coming from two languages I speak — Code and Datu.</p>
            <p>Welcome to my space, and as you come to know me in the digital world, may I leave the impression of love for people and coding.</p>
